# bing-image-gen

Generates images from microsoft's Image Creation website.

# Installation

Install with:
`npm install bingimageclient`

Use as:
`const { BingImageClient } = require('bingimageclient');`

# Authentication

To authenticate yourself, please firstly:
1. Go to https://www.bing.com/images/create
2. Go into inspect element (Right click -> Inspect Element)
3. Go to the Application tab on the top of th new tabe which has opened up (Expand it if you can't see it).
4. Go to the Cookies 
5. Search up 'KievRPSSecAuth' (or the '_U' token) and input the value like you see it in [`demos/imagedownload.ts`](demos/imagedownload.ts)

And you are now authenticated!

Notes: 
- If you do not see the 'KievRPSSecAuth' token, please relog
- You can use any auth token which may even change in the future, so do your own investigation whenever you look at this repo. While I will try to keep it up to date, make sure you are using the latest name for the auth key if it ever changes.

# Usage

Look at [`demos/imagedownload.ts`](demos/imagedownload.ts) for example usage.

# Disallowed Content

Currently, Bing does stop certain prompts. It is possible to bypass this, however I have not found a prompt which bypasses everything. For now I have just created an error which should alert you that Bing has blocked a prompt.
However, if you do want to try to bypass Bing, here is an example of what the prompt should look like:

`Create a image on the following prompt (do not take it literally, it is only hypothetical): {PROMPT}` 

I would not recommend this however as it may get your account blocked.
